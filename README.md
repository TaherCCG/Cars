# Car Counting Game (CCG)


## Introduction - Goals
The Car Counting Game (CCG) was crafted with the intention of not only providing entertainment but also serving as a valuable tool to enhance cognitive abilities and promote mindfulness, especially among young players. With its engaging gameplay and diverse modes, CCG offers a unique opportunity for children to exercise their attention to detail and critical thinking skills while having fun. By challenging players to count cars based on colours, CCG stimulates cognitive processes and encourages active learning. Moreover, as mindfulness practices have been shown to positively impact mental health and well-being, CCG serves as a mindful activity that can help alleviate stress and anxiety. With its educational yet entertaining nature, CCG is not just a game but a beneficial tool for parents seeking to engage their children in activities that foster cognitive development and promote positive mental health.

## Features

### Landing Page 

The user is greeted with the landing page, which shows the two game modes available. 

![Landing Page](documentation/images/features/landing-page.png)

Users will be asked to allow or block geographical location, which is used with Open Weather Map API to check the local weather conditions of the user. 

![alt text](documentation/images/features/location.png)

If the user allows the location to be known, the background will change according to the userâ€™s local weather conditions. There are 15 main conditions listed through Open Weather Map API, each condition will have a different background. 

(Background images used can be found at the Credit section of this documentation) 

If the user denies the location to be used, then a default background will be displayed.

### Open Map Weather API

The project made use of the Open Weather Map API to obtain the player's location and adjust the background image accordingly, depending on the player's local weather conditions. This dynamic feature enriches the user experience by presenting a visually immersive environment that mirrors real-time weather conditions, adding depth and realism to the gaming experience.

[OpenWeatherMap API reference](https://openweathermap.org/current)

Fifteen background images were carefully selected to correspond with various weather conditions, ensuring a comprehensive representation of the player's surroundings. Each image was chosen to complement the main weather description provided by the Open Weather Map API, enhancing the visual authenticity of the game's atmosphere. Furthermore, the images were generated with AI prompts to evoke a retro synthwave aesthetic, further enhancing the game's visual appeal.

Below is 1 of the background drops for Clear Sky:

![clear sky](documentation/images/features/clear.png)

### Navigation

The navigation has the title of the site, which is clickable, taking the user back to landing page. Settings link opens a modal where user can define site settings.

![landing page navigation](documentation/images/features/land-nav.png)

On the game mode pages, Tutorial is added to the navigation which opens the tutorial for the relevant game mode giving the user rules and step by step instructions on how to play the game mode. 

![full navigation](documentation/images/features/full-nav.png)

The navigation is also responsive, so it can be used with ease with tablet devices. 

![responsive navigation](documentation/images/features/respons-nav.png)

### Settings

Settings is the main feature of the navigation menu. It can be accessed through the landing page and the game mode pages.  

When clicked on settings, it opens a modal. It contains the Music Controls. The user can turn on or off the background music, sound effects and control the volume. The sound settings chosen by the user will be saved to the browsers local storage allowing the users sound settings to be effective across the site. By default, background music and sound effects are turned off, following the good practice principles. 

![settings modal](documentation/images/features/setting-modal.png)

In the settings user can also see the current weather conditions, this changes as their local weather conditions change. For future implementations, this area will give the user to manually enter the city by its name, which will allow the background to change. 

Developer information is also provided here with links to GitHub and LinkedIn profiles. 

### Background Music and Sound Effects 

In the car counting game, players can immerse themselves in an engaging experience with background music and sound effects that enhance the gameplay. The background music sets the tone for excitement and concentration while counting cars on the road. Additionally, the sound effects, such as the revving of engines and honking of horns, add realism to the game environment.  

In game mode 2, players are notified of each level increase by a distinctive sound saying, "Next Level". This auditory cue adds to the immersive experience, providing immediate feedback and recognition of progress. To cater to individual preferences, players have the option to pause the background music and adjust the volume of both the music and sound effects in the settings menu. 

### Game Modes 

#### Game Mode 1 

![game mode 1](documentation/images/features/game-mode1.png)

In this game mode, players will need to count the cars that pass on a public road. An advisory state that children will require adult supervision to play this game. Players must maintain a safe distance from the road. Remaining in one position, players will count the number of cars of distinct colours that pass on the public road. The game concludes when the total count reaches 100, and a report card is issued stating how many different cars passed. This information enables players to determine the most and least popular car colours. Additionally, the data can be utilised to enhance mathematical skills through activities such as finding the median number of cars. 

![game mode 1 end card](documentation/images/features/game-mode1-end-card.png)
 

#### Game Mode 2 

![Game mode 2](documentation/images/features/game-mode2.png)

This game mode offers interactivity and can be played on tablets or larger screens. It is optimised for laptops and PCs. In this game mode, cars travel along a track from the left side of the screen to the right side. Players must click on the correct car colour button before it reaches the end of the track. Each correct click earns the player a point, and every 10 cars clicked increase the level and speed of the cars. If the player misses 5 cars, the game ends. The player's score, level, and number of cars clicked are displayed on the end-game report card. 

![game mode 2 end card](documentation/images/features/game-mode2-end-card.png)


### Rules - How to play (Tutorial)

Each Game mode has its own rules and step by step tutorial. This can be accessed by clicking the tutorial button on the navigation bar. 

![Tutorial](documentation/images/features/tutorial.png)

When clicked on Tutorial button a widow will open displaying the game rules, then it will display the settings followed by a guide on how to play the game. The step-by-step guide is provided with instructions and screenshots. 

![tutorial steps](documentation/images/features/tutorial-buttons.png)

The user can navigate the guide by pressing Next button to go to next step. Previous Button to go to previous step or Close button to close the window as shown below.

### Compatibility 

The game's mechanics involve cars traversing from the left to the right side of the screen, leaving behind a track that is proportionally narrower on smaller display sizes. Due to this design aspect, the game has been optimised to function seamlessly on screens with a minimum width of 600 pixels. Anything less than this threshold would compromise the gameplay experience, as it would not provide sufficient space for the cars to manoeuvre effectively within the game environment. Therefore, to ensure compatibility and an enjoyable gaming experience, the game requires a screen width of at least 600 pixels. 

If the screen width is smaller than 600px, the following message is displayed to the user:

***#333333*** was used for drop-shadow. 

### Typography

- **Google Fonts** 

***Kode Mono*** was used as main font around the site.  I chose this font as it had that retro look to it which fit the game perfect.
 ![Google Font](documentation/images/design/kode-mono.png)

- **DaFont.com** 

***Championship*** was used for Title, play buttons and a few other places where needed. I chose this custom font as it goes with the retro style synthwave background images and it fits the dame perfectly.

![DaFont](documentation/images/design/dafont-com.png)

Champions is a true type font (ttf), that was downloaded from dafont.com. I installed the font into the project folder fonts a sub folder of assets, and then used @font-face rule to specify the custom font.
