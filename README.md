# Car Counting Game (CCG)

## Introduction - Goals

The Car Counting Game (CCG) was crafted with the intention of not only providing entertainment but also serving as a valuable tool to enhance cognitive abilities and promote mindfulness, especially among young players. With its engaging gameplay and diverse modes, CCG offers a unique opportunity for children to exercise their attention to detail and critical thinking skills while having fun. By challenging players to count cars based on colour, identify different vehicle types, and recognise car brands through badges, CCG stimulates cognitive processes and encourages active learning. Moreover, as mindfulness practices have been shown to positively impact mental health and well-being, CCG serves as a mindful activity that can help alleviate stress and anxiety. With its educational yet entertaining nature, CCG is not just a game but a beneficial tool for parents seeking to engage their children in activities that foster cognitive development and promote positive mental health.
